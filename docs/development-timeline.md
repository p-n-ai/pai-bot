# pai-bot — Daily Development Timeline

> **Repository:** `p-n-ai/pai-bot`
> **Focus:** KSSM Matematik (Form 1, 2, 3) — Algebra first
> **Duration:** 6 weeks (Day 0 → Day 30)

---

## Scope for pai-bot

pai-bot owns the **core platform**: Go backend, AI gateway, Telegram chat adapter, agent engine, progress tracking, motivation features, and Next.js admin panel. Everything a student interacts with flows through this repo.

**Curriculum scope (first 6 months):** KSSM Matematik only — Form 1, Form 2, Form 3. Algebra topics are the primary validation target because they are sequential (clear prerequisites), assessable (right/wrong answers), and high-demand (students struggle most here).

**TDD note:** All 🤖 tasks include writing tests as part of the task per the TDD workflow in CLAUDE.md. Test-writing is not counted as a separate task — it is embedded in each feature task.

## DAY 0 — SETUP (4.5 hours)

| Task ID | Task | Owner | Time |
|---------|------|-------|------|
| `P-D0-1` | Initialize Go 1.22 project: `cmd/server/main.go`, `internal/{ai,agent,chat,auth,progress,curriculum,platform/{config,database,cache}}`, `migrations/`, `deploy/docker/` | 🤖 Claude Code | 1hr |
| `P-D0-2` | Create `internal/platform/config/config.go` — all env vars with `LEARN_` prefix | 🤖 Claude Code | 30min |
| `P-D0-3` | Create database + cache clients (`pgxpool`, `go-redis`) | 🤖 Claude Code | 1hr |
| `P-D0-4` | Create `docker-compose.yml` (Postgres 17, Dragonfly, app) + multi-stage Dockerfile | 🤖 Claude Code | 30min |
| `P-D0-5` | Create `migrations/001_initial.up.sql` + `down.sql` — tenants, users, progress, conversations (with messages as JSONB column), assessments, streaks, token_budgets, events tables. Schema per technical-plan.md §4 | 🤖 Claude Code | 30min |
| `P-D0-6` | Create AI gateway: Provider interface + OpenAI implementation (configurable base URL — supports DeepSeek and other OpenAI-compatible APIs) + Google Gemini implementation + Ollama implementation + OpenRouter implementation + router with fallback chain. Note: DeepSeek reuses `provider_openai.go` with different base URL — no separate file | 🤖 Claude Code | 2hr |
| `P-D0-7` | GitHub Actions CI: build, test, vet, Docker image build | 🤖 Claude Code | 30min |
| `P-D0-8` | Create Telegram bot via @BotFather, save token | 🧑 Human | 15min |

**Exit:** `docker compose up` runs, health check returns 200, `make test` passes (unit tests for config, gateway, providers), AI gateway compiles with all 5 provider files, GitHub Actions CI workflow committed.
