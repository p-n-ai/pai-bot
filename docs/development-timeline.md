# pai-bot — Daily Development Timeline

> **Repository:** `p-n-ai/pai-bot`
> **Focus:** KSSM Matematik (Form 1, 2, 3) — Algebra first
> **Duration:** 6 weeks (Day 0 → Day 30)

---

## Scope for pai-bot

pai-bot owns the **core platform**: Go backend, AI gateway, Telegram chat adapter, agent engine, progress tracking, motivation features, and Next.js admin panel. Everything a student interacts with flows through this repo.

**Curriculum scope (first 6 months):** KSSM Matematik only — Form 1, Form 2, Form 3. Algebra topics are the primary validation target because they are sequential (clear prerequisites), assessable (right/wrong answers), and high-demand (students struggle most here).

**TDD note:** All 🤖 tasks include writing tests as part of the task per the TDD workflow in CLAUDE.md. Test-writing is not counted as a separate task — it is embedded in each feature task.

## Developer Onboarding — Getting Ready for Day 1

All Day 0 code is committed. Before starting Day 1 tasks, every engineer must set up their local environment.

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Go 1.22+ (backend)
go version   # Expected: go1.22.x or higher

# Docker + Docker Compose
docker --version && docker compose version

# golangci-lint (linter)
golangci-lint --version   # Expected: ≥1.55
# Install if missing: brew install golangci-lint

# Optional but recommended: Air (hot reload)
go install github.com/air-verse/air@latest
```

### Setup Steps

```bash
# 1. Clone and enter the repo
git clone https://github.com/p-n-ai/pai-bot.git
cd pai-bot

# 2. First-time setup (copies .env.example → .env, downloads Go modules)
just setup

# 3. Edit .env — add your Telegram bot token and at least one AI provider key
#    LEARN_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=<your-token>
#    LEARN_AI_OPENAI_API_KEY=<key>   (or any other provider)

# 4. Verify all tests pass
just test

# 5. Start infrastructure (Postgres, Dragonfly, NATS)
docker compose up -d postgres dragonfly nats

# 6. Apply database migrations (goose; version-tracked via goose_db_version)
just migrate

# 7. Verify the server runs and health check works
go run ./cmd/server &
curl http://localhost:8080/healthz   # → {"status":"ok"}
kill %1

# 8. Stop infrastructure when done
docker compose down
```

### Day 1 Task Distribution (4 engineers)

Day 1 has 5 tasks. Tasks 1.1–1.4 can be built in parallel; task 1.5 integrates them all.

| Task ID | Task | Assigned To | Dependencies |
|---------|------|-------------|--------------|
| `P-W1D1-1` | Chat Gateway — `internal/chat/gateway.go` (types + interface + router) | Engineer A | None |
| `P-W1D1-2` | Telegram Adapter — `internal/chat/telegram.go` (long polling, /start, markdown splitting) | Engineer A | Uses types from 1.1 |
| `P-W1D1-3` | Agent Engine — `internal/agent/engine.go` (ProcessMessage pipeline) | Engineer B | Uses `ai.Provider` from Day 0 |
| `P-W1D1-4` | Curriculum Loader — `internal/curriculum/loader.go` (load YAML + teaching notes) | Engineer C | None |
| `P-W1D1-5` | Wire main.go — connect all components, start polling | Engineer D (lead) | After 1.1–1.4 merge |

Engineer mapping:
- Engineer A = @djakajaya89

**Refer to `docs/implementation-guide.md` § Day 1 for exact code templates, test specs, and validation commands for each task.**

**Reminder:** Follow TDD — write `_test.go` first → confirm RED → implement → confirm GREEN → run `just test-all`. Never commit until the full suite passes.

#### Additional Tasks (Out of Initial Plan)

Use this section for any completed or in-progress work that was not listed in the original weekly/day plan.  
When adding a new item here, use an `A-WxDy-...` ID and do not backfill it into the original planned task table.

| Task ID | Task | Owner | Status | Remark |
|---------|------|-------|--------|--------|
| `A-W1D4-LANG-1` | Language preference persistence decision: keep `preferred_language` in `users.config` (no new table), and continue using `/language` + onboarding selector as write paths | 🤖 | ✅ | |
| `A-W1D4-LANG-2` | Language chooser UX follow-up: interactive `/language` state handling for `lang:*` callbacks and explicit confirmation message after button selection | 🤖 | ✅ | |
| `A-W1D4-AI-LIVE-1` | OpenAI live conversation regression suite: `//go:build integration` test reads 30 scripted YAML conversations (2-10 turns) and validates real `agent.Engine.ProcessMessage` behavior (continuity, language profile, structured solving, concept connection, rating flows). CI explicitly skips these live tests via environment detection. | 🤖 | ✅ | |

### Day 5 — Week 1 Retro

**Implementation note (Day 4 decision):** The team intentionally chose not to enforce a hard 30-minute session boundary. Context continuity is handled via rolling conversation compaction and summary in the agent engine.

| Task ID | Task | Owner | Status | Remark |
|---------|------|-------|--------|--------|
| `P-W1D5-1` | 🧑 Run analytics, compile Week 1 numbers | 🧑 Human | ✅ | |
| `P-W1D5-2` | 🧑 1hr retro: demo, review conversations, identify top 3 problems for Week 2 | 🧑 Team | ✅ | |
| `P-W1D5-3` | 🧑 Call top 3 and bottom 3 students — 10min each | 🧑 Human | ✅ | |

**Week 1 Targets:** 10 students used bot, ≥7 returned, avg session ≥6 messages, system prompt v3+. Dual-loop problem-solving pattern and curriculum citations active in all explanations.

**Week 1 Results:** 10 students used bot, 9 returned (90% retention), avg session >10 messages per student. All targets met or exceeded. Proceeding with Week 2 as planned.

| Task ID | Task | Owner | Status | Remark |
|---------|------|-------|--------|--------|
| `A-W1D5-AI-1` | Pulled forward Week 2 AI gateway groundwork for quiz/assessment flows: added `Router.CompleteJSON` with structured-output validation, cheapest-model defaulting, provider fallback on invalid structured responses, and provider-side structured-output support for OpenAI/OpenRouter. This unblocks planned `P-W2D7-3`, but quiz entry/routing and assessment-driven runtime were still pending at that point. | 🤖 | ✅ | |

## WEEK 2 — PROGRESS + ASSESSMENT + 50 STUDENTS

### Day 6 — Mastery Tracking

| Task ID | Task | Owner | Status | Remark |
|---------|------|-------|--------|--------|
| `P-W2D6-1` | Progress tracking: lightweight AI call after each exchange to assess mastery_delta, update learning_progress | 🤖 | ✅ | |
| `P-W2D6-2` | SM-2 spaced repetition scheduler: calculate next_review based on performance | 🤖 | ✅ | |
| `P-W2D6-3` | `/progress` command: Unicode progress bars per topic, XP, streak, next review | 🤖 | ✅ | |
| `P-W2D6-4` | Adaptive explanation depth in system prompt based on mastery level: mastery <0.3 → simple language, more examples, smaller steps; mastery 0.3–0.6 → standard explanations, introduce formal notation gradually; mastery >0.6 → concise, focus on edge cases and cross-topic connections. Include progress context: "Student mastered X, working on Y, struggles with Z" | 🤖 | ✅ | |
| `P-W2D6-5` | 🧑 Recruit 40 more students from Pandai (KSSM Matematik Form 1-3 users) | 🧑 Human | ✅ | Recruited 45 new students from Telegram group |

### Day 7 — Quiz Engine

**Implementation note (March 16, 2026):** `P-W2D7-3` groundwork was pulled forward on Day 5 via `A-W1D5-AI-1`, and the shipped quiz runtime now covers natural-language/button entry, persisted quiz-state routing, deterministic OSS-backed grading, hint/repeat/continue/stop controls, and clean pause/resume behavior around side conversations or teaching detours. The remaining unshipped Day 7 slice is dynamic question generation plus explicit exam-mimicry prompting.

**Current code note (March 16, 2026):** quiz start already works from natural language without `/quiz`. Current implementation starts immediately on first use with a default mixed intensity instead of blocking on an intensity-selection step, remembers explicit per-user intensity preferences when they exist, reuses the existing progress/XP systems so correct quiz answers award quiz XP and quiz outcomes update topic mastery, and pauses cleanly for side conversation or teaching detours instead of grading every off-topic message as a wrong answer. Quiz content is still loaded from OSS `assessments.yaml`; fallback AI question generation is not yet wired into the live runtime.

| Task ID | Task | Owner | Status | Remark |
|---------|------|-------|--------|--------|
| `P-W2D7-1` | Natural-language / button-driven quiz entry: load questions from `assessments.yaml`, present sequentially, deterministic grading for OSS-backed answers, hints on wrong answer, summary at end. Do not require `/quiz` to start. | 🤖 | ✅ | |
| `P-W2D7-2` | Quiz state management: explicit conversation mode in persisted state, route each turn to chat vs quiz handler before tutor AI | 🤖 | ✅ | |
| `P-W2D7-3` | `CompleteJSON` fast-path in AI gateway: structured JSON responses for grading/assessment and dynamic question generation (use cheapest model) | 🤖 | ✅ | |
| `P-W2D7-4` | Exam-style question mimicry: include 2–3 real UASA/SPM exemplar questions per topic in assessments.yaml. AI prompt for dynamic generation says: "Generate a question in the same style, format, and difficulty as these examples: [exemplars]." Inspired by DeepTutor's Mimic Mode | 🤖 | ✅ | AI generates questions via CompleteJSON when static pool exhausted, capped at 10/session |
| `P-W2D7-5` | 🧑 Review all KSSM Algebra assessments for accuracy and pedagogical quality. **Source 2–3 real UASA/SPM exam questions per Algebra topic** as exemplars for the mimic-mode question generator | 🧑 Human | ✅ | Sourced current PT3/UASA exemplars for Algebra topics and injected into assessments pool. |

### Day 8 — Proactive Nudges + Streaks

| Task ID | Task | Owner | Status | Remark |
|---------|------|-------|--------|--------|
| `P-W2D8-1` | Agent scheduler: every 5min check due reviews, respect quiet hours (21:00-07:00 MYT), max 3 nudges/day | 🤖 | ✅ | |
| `P-W2D8-2` | Streak tracking: consecutive days, milestones (3/7/14/30), celebrations, bonus XP | 🤖 | ✅ | |
| `P-W2D8-3` | XP system: session XP, quiz XP (by difficulty), mastery XP, streak XP | 🤖 | ✅ | |
| `P-W2D8-4` | 🧑 Check metrics: how many of 50 students active? Message inactive ones directly | 🧑 Human | ✅ | 42 student active|

### Day 9 — Topic Navigation

|---------|------|-------|--------|--------|
| `P-W2D9-1` | Topic unlocking: when mastery ≥0.8, check prerequisite graph, notify student of newly unlocked topics | 🤖 | ✅ | |
| `P-W2D9-2` | `/learn [topic]` command: set current topic, load teaching notes, start teaching session | 🤖 | ✅ | |
| `P-W2D9-3` | Daily summary event: scheduler at 22:00 computes per-student daily stats | 🤖 | ✅ | |
| `P-W2D9-4` | 🧑 Interview 5 students: "Did you get a bot message today? How did that feel? Was the quiz helpful?" | 🧑 Human | ✅ | Interviewed 6 students and they gave suggestion to improve|

### Day 10 — Week 2 Retro

| Task ID | Task | Owner | Status | Remark |
|---------|------|-------|--------|--------|
| `P-W2D10-1` | 🧑 Compile Week 2 metrics: DAU, Day-7 retention, quiz completion rate, nudge response rate, mastery gain | 🧑 Human | ✅ | Added the metrics based on Postgres data|
| `P-W2D10-2` | 🧑 1hr retro. Decision: ready for motivation features or iterate on core teaching? | 🧑 Team | ✅ | |

**Retro Feedback:** Core teaching loop for Algebra is locked. Telegram simulation results successfully validated [here](../../oss/docs/qa/P-W2D10-2-telegram-simulation-results.md). Ready for Week 3 Motivation Engine.


**Week 2 Targets:** 50 students onboarded, 30+ active, progress tracking + quizzes live, nudge response ≥25%, Day-7 retention ≥35%, adaptive explanation depth adjusting based on mastery level.

**Current code reality (March 16, 2026):** OSS-backed quiz runtime is live. Dynamic quiz generation and explicit exam-style mimicry are still planned follow-up work.

---

## WEEK 3 — MOTIVATION ENGINE

### Day 11 — Goals + Challenges

Status (2026-03-12): `/goal` shipped with natural-language parsing, pending confirmation for vague goals, multiple active goals, `/goal clear`, and `/progress` goal sync. `/challenge` deferred to the next slice.

Migration note (2026-03-18): the repo now uses `goose` with single-file timestamped SQL migrations tracked in `goose_db_version`. `just migrate` runs `goose up -allow-missing` so older timestamped migrations can still be applied after newer ones in out-of-order branch merges. Existing databases that were previously managed by `golang-migrate` should either recreate the local Postgres volume or be explicitly baselined before switching tools. Do not run both migration tools against the same database long-term.

Status (2026-03-18): current `/challenge` surface now covers invite-code challenge creation/join, human matchmaking, bounded human acceptance, and AI fallback after unmatched queue timeout. Shipped scope: challenge migration groundwork now tracked in timestamped goose files (`20260318102000_challenges`, `20260318102100_challenge_acceptance`, `20260318102200_challenge_matchmaking_question_count`), in-memory + Postgres challenge stores, `/challenge invite <topic>`, `/challenge <code>`, bare `/challenge` search/resume, `/challenge cancel`, `/challenge accept`, queue pairing into `pending_acceptance`, timeout-to-AI fallback, and hardening for search expiry, stale matched-ticket cleanup, one-live-challenge/search exclusivity across invite + queue flows, and idempotent same-user search reopening. AI fallback now also preserves the original stored search input, including question count. Terminal-chat smoke verification now passes after fixing persistent store channel alignment and Postgres invite-join locking. Attempt runtime, settlement, XP, and review remain pending.

| Task ID | Task | Owner | Status | Remark |
|---------|------|-------|--------|--------|
| `P-W3D11-1` | Goal setting: `goals` table, `/goal` command, AI parses natural language goal, store and track | 🤖 | ⬜ | |

| `P-W3D11-3` | Peer challenges: `challenges` table, `/challenge` command, 6-char challenge code, 5-question simultaneous quiz, results with XP | 🤖 | ⬜ | |
| `P-W3D11-4` | 🧑 Design battle question sets for all KSSM Algebra topics, standardized per difficulty | 🧑 Human | ✅ | 5-5-5 Rule. Injected new pedagogical schema metadata. |

**Implementation note (Late Mar 2026):** All Form 1, Form 2, and Form 3 Algebra assessment pools have been comprehensively standardized for the Battle Engine. 
*   **The "5-5-5" Rule:** Every topic pool now guarantees a minimum baseline of 5 Easy, 5 Medium, and 5 Hard questions.
*   **What's New:** Injected new pedagogical schema metadata not present in earlier versions, including explicit `tp_level` (1-6) routing, `kbat: true/false` flags for higher-order tracking, and `# EXAM: UASA` provenance tags to map AI models directly to national exam formats (OAP, OPB, Subjektif). Upgraded Form 3 pools with brand new TP6 non-routine application problems.

Current note: `P-W3D11-3` is only partially complete. The shipped Day 11 slice is the challenge-creation and matchmaking baseline listed below; the simultaneous quiz runtime, results settlement, XP award, and post-challenge review parts of that planned task still belong to later slices.

|---------|------|-------|--------|--------|
| `P-W4D17-1` | Admin API: GET classes/{id}/progress, GET students/{id}/detail, GET students/{id}/conversations, GET ai/usage | 🤖 | ✅ | Also shipping GET /api/admin/metrics, GET /api/admin/parents/{id}, POST /api/admin/students/{id}/nudge, and POST /api/admin/invites |
| `P-W4D17-2` | Parent view: child summary card, weekly stats, mastery progress bars, AI-generated encouragement suggestion | 🤖 | ✅ | |
| `P-W4D17-3` | Form/syllabus selection: after /start ask "Tingkatan berapa? 1️⃣ Form 1, 2️⃣ Form 2, 3️⃣ Form 3" — load correct curriculum | 🤖 | ⬜ | |
| `P-W4D17-4` | 🧑 Show admin panel to 2 pilot teachers via screen share, collect feedback | 🧑 Human | ⬜ | |

Implementation note (2026-03-30): auth/session work is ahead of the original sequence. Shipped: `auth_identities`, `auth_invites`, `auth_refresh_tokens`, invite acceptance, email/password login, refresh, logout, and protected Next.js routes for teacher/parent/admin/platform-admin. Still pending: bot-side form selection.

### Day 18 — Deploy Admin + Class Management

| Task ID | Task | Owner | Status | Remark |
|---------|------|-------|--------|--------|
| `P-W4D18-1` | Deploy admin: add to docker-compose, nginx reverse proxy (api/* → Go, /* → Next.js) | 🤖 | ✅ | Docker Compose, admin image build, and reverse proxy config are in repo under `deploy/caddy` and `deploy/nginx`. |
| `P-W4D18-2` | Class management page: create class + syllabus, join code, member list, assign topics to class | 🤖 | ⬜ | Frontend scaffold exists in `admin/src/app/dashboard/classes/page.tsx`, but it still uses mock data because class CRUD, join-code, membership, and topic-assignment APIs are not implemented yet. |
| `P-W4D18-3` | 🧑 Test all 3 Forms (F1, F2, F3) with bot — does content switch correctly? | 🧑 Human | ⬜ | |

| `P-W4D19-2` | Token budget tracking page: daily trend, per-student avg, and budget limits for AI token allowance tracking | 🤖 | ✅ | Current shipped scope is token-allowance tracking: tenant token budget window, used/remaining tokens, daily token trend, and per-student average tokens. This Week 4 scope is AI-token-only, not real-money spend tracking. |
| `P-W4D19-3` | 🧑 Test KSSM Form 2 Algebra with 5 Malaysian students. Does teaching quality hold across all 3 forms? | 🧑 Human | ⬜ | |

#### Additional Tasks (Out of Initial Plan)

Use this section for any completed or in-progress work that was not listed in the original weekly/day plan.  
When adding a new item here, use an `A-WxDy-...` ID and do not backfill it into the original planned task table.

| Additional ID | Task | Status | Owner |
|---------------|------|--------|-------|
| `A-W4D16-UI-1` | Admin panel shadcn/ui migration plan: standardize the remaining admin screens around shared `@/components/ui` primitives, lock design-token ownership in `globals.css`, migrate forms first, layout/navigation second, data-display surfaces third, and remove duplicated bespoke UI after each slice. | ✅ | 🤖 |
| `A-W4D16-UI-2` | First shadcn/ui migration slice: introduce a shared admin surface wrapper component and move the dashboard mastery heatmap onto the local shadcn table primitives instead of a bespoke table implementation. | ✅ | 🤖 |
| `A-W4D16-UI-3` | Second shadcn/ui migration slice: extract the admin login form into reusable shadcn-based form components (`FormField`, `LoginFormCard`), replace the native tenant selector with the shared select primitive, and add component tests for the new auth form surface. | ✅ | 🤖 |
| `A-W4D16-UI-4` | Third shadcn/ui migration slice: add the missing invite-acceptance entry point at `/activate`, reuse the shared auth form primitives for password setup, connect it to `POST /api/auth/invitations/accept`, and add component tests for the activation form state. | ✅ | 🤖 |
| `A-W4D16-UI-5` | Fourth shadcn/ui migration slice: add a reusable admin invite-issuance form, wire it to `POST /api/admin/invites` from the class-management operations area, and surface the generated `/activate` link for teacher, parent, and admin onboarding. | ✅ | 🤖 |
| `A-W4D16-UI-6` | Fifth shadcn/ui migration slice: standardize the analytics pages and shell support panels on shared wrappers by moving metrics and AI usage page sections to `AdminSurface` and replacing repeated sidebar inset cards with a shared `AdminInsetPanel`. | ✅ | 🤖 |
| `A-W4D16-UI-7` | Sixth shadcn/ui migration slice: standardize the home, student detail, and parent summary pages on shared wrappers by introducing reusable highlight and link-card components and replacing repeated content cards with `AdminSurface`, `AdminInsetPanel`, and `AdminHighlightPanel`. | ✅ | 🤖 |
| `A-W4D16-UI-8` | Seventh shadcn/ui migration slice: refactor the remaining class-management view onto shared wrappers by introducing reusable class-list and topic-progress components and replacing bespoke class tiles, selected-class summary, and topic rows with shared shadcn-based surfaces. | ✅ | 🤖 |
| `A-W4D16-UI-9` | Shared frontend cleanup after the shadcn migration: remove the last admin lint issues in the theme toggle, async resource hook, and small shared components so `admin/` now passes `npm run lint` cleanly. | ✅ | 🤖 |
| `A-W4D16-UI-10` | Admin shell hydration fix: move theme hydration state into the provider and keep `ThemeToggle` as a thin consumer while preserving deterministic pre-hydration markup so SSR and client output stay aligned. | ✅ | 🤖 |
| `A-W4D16-UI-11` | Shared hydration hardening: add a reusable `useHydrated` hook and apply it to invite activation so client-stored session reads stay behind a deterministic hydration boundary instead of running during SSR/client reconciliation. | ✅ | 🤖 |
| `A-W4D16-UI-12` | Replace the custom admin theme store and inline boot script with `next-themes`, keeping the existing toggle UX while delegating class, storage, and color-scheme synchronization to the maintained provider to reduce hydration mismatch risk. | ✅ | 🤖 |
| `A-W4D19-BUDGET-3` | Budget tracking follow-up: add admin write flows for tenant token budget windows so admins can create or update token limits from the AI usage screen instead of relying on seeded or manually inserted `token_budgets` rows. | ✅ | 🤖 | `POST /api/admin/ai/budget-window` is live for admin users, and the AI usage screen now exposes a tenant token budget editor. |
